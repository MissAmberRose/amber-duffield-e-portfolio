## About

> In my journey as an SEO expert, I've been actively involved in devising and implementing strategies that drive organic traffic, leveraging tools such as **Google Suite**, **Ahrefs**, **SEMRush**, and **ScreamingFrog**. 

While my passion remains rooted in SEO, I'm currently expanding my skillset to become a fully qualified Front-End Web Developer. I am proficient in HTML & CSS, intermediate in JavaScript, and a beginner in R, Ruby, and Python. I'm also adept at using Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Canva, Notion, Miro, Wistia, and Descript. Concurrently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of IT to further strengthen my technical expertise.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I love gardening, walking my dog, and baking, especially sourdough bread. These activities provide a unique sense of satisfaction and balance, allowing me to nurture my creative side.
